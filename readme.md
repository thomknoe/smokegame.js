# The Game of Smoking

The Game of Smoking is a 1D game that promotes awareness around smoking cessation through an interactive wearable device that resembles a cigarette. Players perform smoking-like actions, such as bringing the device close to their mouth or tapping the device’s base, in response to signals to progress through the level. As the game advances, it alters these signals to disrupt the motor-sensory patterns associated with smoking, creating confusion and reconditioning behavior.
