The Game of Smoking is a 1D game that promotes awareness around smoking cessation through an interactive wearable device that resembles a cigarette. Players perform smoking-like actions, such as bringing the device close to their mouth or tapping the deviceâ€™s base, in response to signals to progress through the level. As the game advances, it alters these signals to disrupt the motor-sensory patterns associated with smoking, which creates confusion and reconditions the playser's behavior.
